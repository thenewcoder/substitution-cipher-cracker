# substitution-cipher-cracker
A very simple and flawed substitution cipher cracker

This was the very first program I ever coded in python, many years ago.
The inspiration came from the movies and TV shows I was watching at
the time. In several of them, the main character(s) would come
across some kind of ciphered text that was crucial to their mission
in some way. Very often, it was just a kind of substitution cipher.
And so I thought, it would be really fun to "crack the code" before
they did, and not having to wait until later parts of the movie to
read the secret message.

It was originally written in python 2.x, and so I've decided to
convert it to python 3.x. Also, while this version will have some
initial improvements to the original, I am going to leave some
parts intact, including some "bad practices". Maybe just for
sentimental reasons. I might change my mind later.
